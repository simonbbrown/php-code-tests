# Level 2 - Palindrome
Write the most efficient function you can that determines whether a given string is a palindrome. Your function should accept a string as a parameter and return a boolean (true if the string is a palindrome, false if it's not).
Assume that this code will be put into a real production system and write accordingly.

Some palindrome examples include: 
* race car
* step on no pets
* A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!
* Amor, Roma
* stack cats
* taco cat
* put it up
* was it a car or a cat I saw?
* no x in nixon
