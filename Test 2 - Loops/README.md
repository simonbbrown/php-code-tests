# Level 2 - Loops

Build an algorithm that will count and return the number of items which appear in both arrays. For instance the following arrays both contain 3 and 7 so the answer is 2

Avoid using inbuild PHP functions like: in_array, array_intersect, array_unique etc.

Functions like: for, while, foreach, count, if/else are allowed.
